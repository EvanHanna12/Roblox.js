# Roblox.js - A proprietary bot for my roblox group and discord server.
  Don't try to add this bot to your server. Only *I* can add it to servers.
  
  I started this project on my slave linux laptop, but it went down and I have to rebuild the whole damn thing.
  Functions: {
    Shouting,
    Wall Posting,
    Exiling,
    more
  }
  I will eventually make a public version of this bot. The only reason there isn't already one is because of my lack of knowledge for mongoose.
